# Harumiya

This is a storyteller assistant app that uses Google's Gemini API and RAG to create the skeleton of a setting for creative projects like novels or custom campaigns for RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. It uses the Rust Axum web framework on the backend and React Remix on the front end. It also uses Qdrant to store embeddings generated by Google's Embeddings API.


## Setup

You will need Rust and Node.js to run this project. You will also need to create a .env file at root level with your own Google API keys.

Go to the harumiya-frontend directory and follow the instructions there for the frontend. Then in another window, use `cargo run` to start up the backend.

It also does not come with documents for embedding; you can add a documents folder at root level with your own. Then uncomment out the `embed_documentation` function in the main Rust file to embed documents on startup.
